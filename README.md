# Python-mini-project

This repository contains three beginner-friendly Python projects developed for practice and skill-building. Each project focuses on basic Python concepts like conditionals, loops, functions, and random number generation.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Number Guessing Game üéØ

A simple interactive game where the computer randomly selects a number within a predefined range, and the player has to guess it.

How it works:

The program generates a random number (e.g., between 1 and 100).

The player inputs their guess.

The program gives hints ‚Äî "Too High" or "Too Low" ‚Äî until the correct number is guessed.

Tracks the number of attempts taken by the player.

Concepts used: random module, loops, conditionals, and user input handling.

Objective: Practice logic building and understand how to implement feedback loops in games.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Simple Calculator ‚ûï‚ûñ‚úñÔ∏è‚ûó

A basic command-line calculator capable of performing fundamental arithmetic operations.

How it works:

The user provides two numbers.

The program displays a menu for choosing an operation (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division).

Based on the choice, the calculation is performed and the result is shown.

Handles invalid inputs and division by zero errors gracefully.

Concepts used: Functions, conditionals, and basic error handling.

Objective: Learn how to structure code for multiple operations and handle user choices effectively.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Rock-Paper-Scissors Game ‚úäüìÑ‚úÇÔ∏è

A classic hand game simulation where the user competes against the computer.

How it works:

The player selects either Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

The computer randomly picks its move.

The winner is determined based on standard rules:

Rock beats Scissors

Scissors beats Paper

Paper beats Rock

If both choose the same, it‚Äôs a draw.

Concepts used: random module, conditional logic, and string comparisons.

Objective: Understand game logic implementation and decision-making in programs.
